kubuntu-driver-manager (14.04ubuntu4) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Depend on python3-qt4 for the auto-quit logic in the helper LP: #1293948
  * Refactor
    - dbus helper now only has one function
    - dbus interaction uses explicit type demarshalling
    - new struct types Device and Driver representing the explicit dbus types
    - new class DriverManager encorporating most logic bits of Module such as
      dbus and qapt interaction
    - DriverWidget QApt queries moved to DriverManager's dbus handling, but
      continues to query qapt packages directly for name and such nonesense
    - Manual driver listing is no longer explicitly dependent on package
      findability
    - DriverWidget changes detection now happen through iterative queries
      in Module::possiblyChanged, fixing change tracking
    - Module continues to contain Debconf handling, pipe id merely passed to
      DriverManager
    - New Module functions enableUi and disableUi containing reoccuring logic
    - DriverWidget does not implicitly create left-to-right strings anymore
    - Module::load is now the grand unified way to trigger a (re)load of data
      while DriverManager::refresh synchronizes the reload requests with
      QApt/Xapian init, fixing all likely and less likely init order problems
    - New struct Device provides deep qdebug stream operators to debug
      stuff conveniently
    - Module includes have been cleaned up slightly
    - Drivers are now not only installed, but also removed, this effectively
      enables actual driver change as the way management works is that the
      consideration is that only one driver is installed at a time (except for
      the free version), which also is why manual always wins active
      detection as it simply prevents any other driver from being considered.
